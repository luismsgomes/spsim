class PhraseSpSim(SpSim):
    '''
    Measures the similarity between pairs of phrases using SpSim for comparing
    words.

    A phrase is a sequence one or more words.

                January 2010, Lu√≠s Gomes <luismsgomes@gmail.com>

    Works as follows:
    1 - Compute the distance between each word A of one phrase and each word B
        of the  other phrase using (1 - SpSim(A, B)) * max(len(A), len(B)).
    2 - Compute the one-to-one assignment of words from one phrase to words
        of the other phrase that minimizes the sum of all pair distances. If
        the phrases have a different number of words, then we add null words
        to the shortest phrase. The distance between any word C and null is
        len(C).
    3 - The similarity score is computed as 1 - D/L, where D is the minimum
        total distance (computed in 2) and L is the length of the longest
        phrase, excluding whitespace.

    Step 2 is computed using the Munkres algorithm (aka Hungarian). Note that
    the problem solved in step 2 is widely known as "the assignment problem".

    >>> sim = PhraseSpSim()
    >>> sim.learn([('photo', 'foto'), ('alpha', 'alfa'), ('pangea', 'pangeia')])
    >>> sorted(sim.diffs.items())
    [('\\ti', 'ea'), ('ph\\tf', '**')]

    SpSim has learned that 'ph' may be replaced by 'f' and 'ea' by 'eia'.

    >>> sim('phenomenal idea', 'ideia fenomenal')
    1.0
